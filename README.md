## Free VPS

[A good free VPS from Oracle. It offers 24gb ram, 4 cores and 200gb of storage. It's ARM but works with this setup.](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/)

## Recommended tools
SSH: [Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)

File Explorer: [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php)

All-in-one recommendation: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the Remote Explorer extension installed.

**DON"T LOOSE YOUR SSH KEY FILE!!!** Without this you won't be able to connect to your Oracle server - keep it somewhere **SAFE**

## Installing Docker

First of all you need Docker. [You can download it by following this guide here.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

This guide is for ubuntu but you can find guides for other operating systems/distributions on their website.

Here is a summary of the install commands from the guide:

Step 1: Update the Package Index and Install Prerequisites

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
```

Step 2: Add Dockerâ€™s Official GPG Key

```
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
```

Step 3: Set Up the Stable Repository

```
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] \
https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

Step 4: Update the Package Index Again

```
sudo apt-get update
```

Step 5: Install latest Docker Engine

```
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

Step 6: Enable and Start Docker

```
sudo systemctl enable docker
```
```
sudo systemctl start docker
```

Step 5: Add user to the docker group & activate the changes

```
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
```
newgrp docker
```

You can verify your Docker installation by running `docker --version`

## Creating a user for docker (Recommended)

For better security, it's recommended to set up a separate user for Docker containers.

```
sudo adduser dockercontainers
```

To be able to use docker with this user add them to the docker group

```
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker dockercontainers
```

You can log into the new account by entering this command:

```
su - dockercontainers
```

## Setting up the server

After you've got docker installed you can start by downloading the pre-setup.sh file to the root of your home folder.

You can do this with:

```
cd ~
```
```
wget [download link for the pre-setup.sh file]
```

**BEFORE RUNNING** - If you have existing docker container & github repository locations - edit pre-setup.sh and adjust the directory paths to suit your needs.

Now we're going to make the script executable:

```
chmod +x pre-setup.sh
```

Now we're going to run pre-setup.sh:

```
wget [download link for the pre-setup.sh file]
```

Once the server is ready - you can exit the logs but pressing **Ctrl + C**

## Helpful Docker commands

To see the logs of the container:

```
docker logs -f fika
```

You can use **Ctrl + C** to exit the logs.

To stop the container:

```
docker stop fika
```

To restart the container:

```
docker restart fika
```

## Updating to newer versions

First off you will have to stop the server with:

```
docker stop fika
```

It is recommended to backup profiles in your server/user/profiles directory. 

The server path is defined in the pre-setup script and if not edited - should be in ($HOME/docker/containers/spt-fika/server/user/profiles)

You can copy them with this command:

```
cp -r $HOME/docker/containers/spt-fika/server/user/profiles $HOME/docker/containers/backups/fika/profiles
```

If you have any mods installed - you can use the following commands to backup server & client mods:

```
cp -r $HOME/docker/containers/spt-fika/server/user/mods $HOME/docker/containers/backups/fika/mods
```
```
cp -r $HOME/docker/containers/spt-fika/server/BepInEx $HOME/docker/containers/backups/fika/BepInEx
```

Since we're updating FIKA/SPT - we need to remove the old FIKA mod from the backup:

```
rm -rf $HOME/docker/containers/backups/fika/mods/fika-server
```

Next we need to delete the container and the image. We can do that by running these commands:

```
cd /home/ubuntu/docker/containers/spt-fika/files
```
```
docker compose down
```

Confirm the current image version:

```
docker images
```

Replace the current version for the dildz/spt-fika-X.X.X image in the next command:

```
docker rmi dildz/spt-fika-CURRENT_VERSION
```
```
docker builder prune
```

Now we need the latest spt-fika image.

[Navigate to DockerHub to copy the latest spt-fika image pull command](https://hub.docker.com/u/dildz)

Pull the new spt-fika image by pasting the pull command:

```
docker pull dildz/spt-fika-NEW_VERSION
```

After that we can rebuild the container:

```
docker compose up -d && docker compose logs -f fika
```

Now your server is updated.

You can use **Ctrl + C** to exit the logs.

To restore any backed up profiles & mods we can run the following commands:

```
docker stop spt-fika
```
```
sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu $HOME/docker/containers/spt-fika/server
```
```
cp -r $HOME/docker/containers/backups/fika/profiles $HOME/docker/containers/spt-fika/server/user/
```
```
cp -r $HOME/docker/containers/backups/fika/mods $HOME/docker/containers/spt-fika/server/user/
```
```
cp -r $HOME/docker/containers/backups/fika/BepInEx $HOME/docker/containers/spt-fika/server/
```

With backups restored you can now start the fika container back up:

```
docker start fika && docker compose -f fika
```

You can use **Ctrl + C** to exit the logs.

[To update your client you can follow the instructions here.](https://dev.sp-tarkov.com/SPT/Stable-releases/releases) [You will also need to download the newest Fika plugin from here.](https://github.com/project-fika/Fika-Plugin/releases)

## Modding and other possibly helpful info

To play with your friends you first have to port forward or disable the firewall for port 6969 on the server.

To host Co-Op raids with your friends you either have to have UPnP enabled or have port 25565 forwarded to your PC. 
You should also disable the firewall for the EscapeFromTarkov.exe and allow ports in the firewall. [More info over here](https://github.com/project-fika/Fika-Documentation?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

To add more mods to the game you have to add them to the "users" directory in the server directory.

http.json should be pre configured for port forwarding in this setup.

[You might also want to look into making automatic backups with cron.](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/16954)

It's not necessary but it's a plus. I'm not going to go into it in depth but if someone wants they are free to make a simple guide for it.
